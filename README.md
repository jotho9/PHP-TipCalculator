## Notes

This was my first web development application so I had never programmed with PHP, HTML, or CSS. The most challenging aspect of this project was wrighting code with three different languages in the same application. This became particularly challenging when trying to implement the radio buttons with the for-loop and ensuring that the previously selected button remained selected after the page reloaded. I learned a lot so the experience was worth-while and I hope to learn more about web development and security during the course.
